## Yet another poorly written Alarm Manager

Because I have serious problems waking up too early in the morning.

### Dependencies

Other than what is listed in `requirements.txt`, you'll also need the following packages:
* mpv
* figlet
* cowsay

And, obviously, I've only tested this on my personal machine running Arch Linux with the latest version of everything. Good Luck.
