# TODO:
#     read_config_file(foo)
#         Open config file
#         Read each line and ignore comments
#             Looking for foo
#         Split in '=' sign
#         Store foo value in a variable
#         Close config file
#         return foo
#
#     get_foo()
#         Call read_config_file(foo)
#         Store foo value in a variable
#         return foo

#
#     Each value is supposed to have its own getter, I guess...
#
#     Remind to google the best way for doing this in Python
